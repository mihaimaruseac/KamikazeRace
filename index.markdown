For now, this is only a test. I really like [GitHub].

It seems that CSS didn't work for the first time. I'm taking bits and bits of
it from various places (mainly Octopress and some Jekyll examples here and
there) and putting them togheter to create something awesome.

Bear with me and think of the question for which the following is true :)

Answer: {{ site.answer }}

SiteURL: {{ site.url }}

PageURL: {{ page.url }}

ROOT: {{ root_url }}

DEST: {{ site.destination }}

SOURCE: {{ site.source }}
